    <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
    <p>Highschool students tend to stress out to find a college that best fits their future. The information about
      universities with the best suited programs, environments, and industry connections can be fragmented. Overall, our
      general topic of interest: How can we reduce the fragmentation of information for highschool students to find
      their best fit university. More specifically, highschool students in marganlzied communities are provided with
      very little guidance in the United States. Generally, US public schools are funded by property-tax, the more
      economically well off communities are able to generate higher cash-flow for their schools which allows them to
      develop a fast amount of resources for their students. On the other hand, low-income communities arenâ€™t able to
      provide all their students with the resources to prepare for their next chapter. Currently, there is an existing
      solution created by collegeboard in which it allows students to develop their college list and see what college
      will best fit them based on interests & test scores. In all, we want to build off this to be able to allow
      students to have all students of all backgrounds be able to find the college that will allow them to best for fill
      their goals. We want to develop something that will look further than just the students test scores, and field of
      interest, but provide them with suggestions of options they may have not thought of that will allow them to expand
      their higher-education horizon.

    <h2>App description</h2>
    <p>Our website is dedicated to helping students select the right college, so I, our main users are students who are
      about to graduate from high school, in addition to students' parents or teachers who may also visit our website to
      help students choose their future colleges. Of course, anyone who wants to learn about colleges may visit our
      site.The site will display a ranked list representing each university based on the user's choices. Each row of the
      list will match the user's preferences, and when the user clicks on one of the universities, basic information
      about that university will be displayed. We currently base this site on the <a
        href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohaiminul101/world-university-rankings-usa"> data</a>. We will also be
      looking for more data to support our site afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>With our web app, users will be able to find universities or colleges that best fit their interests or other
      information gathered in the survey. Before suggesting results to users, we will first interact by having them take
      a quick survey to ask about their preferred academic interests, SAT/ACT scores, tuition rates, or any other
      criteria they want to use to look for their universities. Also, once users decide on some universities that they
      are interested in, we will provide a feature that allows them to easily compare their favorite universities to
      help them make a quick decision. We will quickly be able to collect users' information about their preferences
      based on the survey. Then, we will try to reduce users' work and find universities for them that best match their
      interests. Therefore, users will be able to save time in deciding on universities and focus on preparing for other
      admissions to the university.
